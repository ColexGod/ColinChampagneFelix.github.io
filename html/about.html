    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I'm a 19 years old new front end developper. I've been interested in programmation since i was 13 and I've been looking at tons of different projects, websites and games since then.</p>
    <p> I started learning code in 2022 and I've been focusing my efforts in developing websites and applications since I started. I don't have much experience in the domain but I learn quickly.</p>
    <p>I'm open to job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches my skills and experience then don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
